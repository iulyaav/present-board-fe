What I want out of this app:

- I can log in and see all my sessions
- I can create sessions to which I can invite friends
- The sessions are like rooms that can be created, closed or deleted;
- In a session I have multiple participants
- There are multiple types of sessions:
	- idea boards -> everyone puts in ideas for other people (e.g. What should I get for Christmas for my friends?)
	- wishlist boards -> I put ideas for myself (e.g. What do I want for my birthday?)

- Public sessions should be accessible without an account
- Private sessions might either only be accessible by me or by people I allow 


Ideas for the future:
- roulette for present given filters (budget, etc)
- links to items
